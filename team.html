          <h2>Eli</h2>
          <p>Eli Williams refused to write his own bio. He wears nothing but black shirts with sarcastic writing, and he is very introverted. He has been doing robotics since freshman year, and is now a sophomore. He does some sort of programming that is confusing to this author. I assume he enjoys robotics, since he comes to the meetings very regularly. "I don't have good quotes," he says</p>

          <p>My name is Hye Jeong Yun, please call me Hye because no one can say my actual name, and I've been doing robotics for three years- I'm a sophomore now. My favorite part of robotics is bonding with my team- they're like a second family to me. I'm looking forward to all our mistakes this year, and to fixing them. I like to read, play PC games, and eat food. "The heart has its reasons which reason knows nothing" - Blaise Pascal :)</p>

          <p>Kemyl Tadeo has been in robotics for five years. His job for the team is working on building and design- Kemyl wants to be a mechanical engineer after college. His main hobbies are homework and studying. In his free time, he studies. He thinks the competition this year is really difficult, but he believes the team will be able to do well. He is very dedicated to robotics.</p>

          <p>Kevin Santiago is a sophomore, he has been doing robotics since seventh grade. He is always enthusiastic and pessimistic about coming to meetings. His job on the team is chronicling in the engineering notebook, doing wiring, making bad jokes, and telling the truth even if it hurts other people. His hobbies are reading, drawing and playing mobile games. He thinks the competition this year (2015-2016) is interesting and challenging. but when he is the only one they can depend on he would joke around and say no, but in the end will do it. Hates nothing and accepts everyone!!</p>

          <h2>Corey Porter</h2>
		  <h4>(Programming, Pizza)</h4>
          <p>In 2012, a crack programmer was sent to mentor the Suit Bots by a military court for a crime he didn't commit. He promptly escaped from this maximum security stockade to the Monrovia High School Robotics program. Today, still wanted by the government, he survives as a Robotics Mentor of fortune. If you have a programming problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find him... maybe you can work with Corey. (He also fetches pizza when the team gets hungry.)</p>

          <p>Long time LA FTC supporter and physics teacher extraordinaire, Mr. Dobson coaches all of MHS's robotics teams, including, sometimes reluctantly, Team 4628 Suit Bots. He helps keep us organized and on schedule, provides invaluable insight into tackling game challenges, helps us keep our finances in order and our motivation strong. Mr. Dobson was the very deserving winner of the Compass Award at LA FTC Regionals during the Cascade Effect season.</p>
